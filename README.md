# Classifying-data
<p>This task joins accessibility datasets into a grid and visualizes them by using a classifier.

The task explores the dominance area for one of the shopping centers (Itis) in Helsinki with different travel modes (Public transport, private car).
The dominance area is the geographical area from where the given service (shopping center) is the closest one to reach in terms of travel time.
    
The datasets include a text file containing data about accessibility in Helsinki Region and a Shapefile that contains a Polygon grid that can be used to visualize and analyze the data spatially. The datasets are:

<ul>
    <li>TravelTimes_to_5944003_Itis.txt - Includes travel times and road network distances to The Itis shopping center</li>
    <li>MetropAccess_YKR_grid_EurefFIN.shp - Includes a Polygon grid with 'YKR_ID' column that can be used to join the grid with the accessibility data</li>
</ul>
